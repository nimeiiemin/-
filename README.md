僵尸网络是一种新型恶意软件，其采用C/S结构，通常由僵尸主控者在C&amp;C服务器上发布命令，众多僵尸接受命令后可以相互协同对受害主机一起发动恶意攻击。本课题研究内容为设计并实现一个僵尸网络模拟演练软件，操作演示僵尸网络的攻击原理、攻击过程。


The botnet is a new type of malware that uses the C/S structure, in which commands are usually issued by the zombie master on the C&C server. Many zombies can use the commands to collaborate against eachother to attack victim host.The research content of this topic is to design and implement a botnet simulation software,which can perform the attack principle and attack process of botnet.
